    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
        This is a fully functional yet simple chess program that aims to help you to understand how a chess engine works.<br />
        There are already open source chess engines on the Internet which focus on high performance.<br />
        This is a standard object oriented C# solution that is meant to be easier to understand.<br />
        The focus has not been to make a fast and high rated chess engine. I have developed a working chess AI that plays descent good moves with code that you hopefully like to read.<br />
        A few of the more specific goals has been to correctly implement Alpha Beta Pruning and Zobrist Hashing in a way that I think can be understood by most developers.
    </p>

    <H2>Background</H2>
    <p>
        I have tried before (about ten years ago) to implement a chess engine. This time I decided to use the TDD test first approach.<br />
        I like TDD and I think using TDD was the main reason the engine worked this time. It is very important that the rules of chess are 100% correct implemented.<br />
        Equally important is that undoing moves result exactly into the previous state.<br />
        I also think that TDD contributes to good code structure and a maintainable system design.
    </p>

    <h2>The code</h2>
    <p>
        The solution consists of two main projects. The engine (chess.dll) and the user interface.<br />
        Chess.dll has everything about the game, the board, the rules and the engine.<br />
        It also contains all tests. I saw no reason for having unit-tests in a separate project in this implementation. This way one can easily see what unit-tests belongs to which class.<br />
        There are currently 78 tests. Most of them are very fast and code coverage is about 100%.
        Total number of lines of code are just under 3000, including tests and user interface.<br />
        The engine and game class where most of the logic is, is less than 700 lines of code.
    </p>

    <p>The Chess UI is a Windows Forms application with only a few features like load, save and setting the time for computer to think.</p>
    <p>
        There is a lot of free and good literature on the web explaining the different algorithms and techniques in a chess engine.<br />
        Below you find links to pages that has helped me.<br />
    </p>

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Iterative <a href="http://will.thimbleby.net/algorithms/doku.php?id=minimax_search_with_alpha-beta_pruning" target="_blank">Alpha-Beta Pruning</a>, which drastically decreases the number of positions that needs to be analyzed.<br /> At depth zero a depth two <a href="https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Quiescence+Search">Quiescence Search</a> is also performed to prevent the risk of <a href="https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Horizon+Effect" target="_blank">horizon effect</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Zobrist+Hashing" target="_blank">Zobrist Hashing</a> to create fast lookup for already evaluated positions. I keep a few million positions in a database so every position only has to be calculated once.</li>
        <li>Parallel threads to increase performance of engine if multiple cores are available.</li>
        <li>The chess board is represented by a single square[64] array. (Bit-boards are a lot faster but perhaps little bit more complicated.)</li>
        <li>Score of the position is based on material and a positional score for each piece. In the opening, a few basic opening principles gives extra points. Special calculations are also performed in the end game.</li>
        <li>Draw by repetition, insufficient material and stale mate are also evaluated.</li>
        <li><i>Opening book is not yet implemented</i></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Chess Engine</h2>
    <p>This is how my chess engine is implemented</p>
    <h3>The board</h3>
    The engine must of course understand what chess is.<br />
    There are types for the board, its squares, the pieces and their sub types. Also two players, black and white.
    <h3>Moves</h3>
    Each piece type has a move pattern. It is used to generate moves.
    A list of pseudo legal moves are generated for all pieces of a player. After a pseudo legal move is made it is tested weather the own king is in check.
    Own king can´t be in check after a move so those moves are illegal in chess.<br />
    The legal moves are kept.
    <h3>Evaluation</h3>
    It is actually better to evaluate moves right away. That is because the search is much more effective when moves are ordered. More about that later.<br />
    Evaluation gives a score. If black is better it is positive and negative for positions in favor of white.<br />
    Each piece has a value. Queen is nine. Rook five. Bishops and knight three and pawns are one.<br />
    The material score is sum of blacks pieces subtracted by sum of whites.<br />
    Position of pieces are also important. My chess engine evaluates
    <ul>
        <li>
            Control of center (d and e pawn on rank 4 for white and rank 5 for black)
        </li>
        <li>Rooks on open files</li>
        <li>Queen movement in the opening is bad.</li>
        <li>Castling to get the king safe is good.</li>
        <li>Bad knights close to the border.</li>
        <li>Double pawns</li>
        <li>Moving bishops and knights once and only once in the opening is good</li>
    </ul>
    Evaluation is also about the game ending and who is the winner. When a player is in check and has no legal moves it is check mate and the score is set to a very large number if black wins and very low for white.<br />
    As you probably know, a chess game can also end in draw if a player has no legal moves (Stale mate) or if a game has repeated the same position three times.<br />
    The game also ends in a draw if no capture or pawn move has been made the last 50 moves.
    <h3>Search</h3>
    Now that we can tell bad moves from good we can search for good moves.<br />
    It is first decided at what depth a search should be performed. It starts at depth 1<br />
    White player makes his moves and between every white move black player makes his moves for every white move.<br />
    Since black player will try its best to get as large score as possible, the best move for white is the move that results into a list of black response moves with the lowest max value.<br />
    This min max search is also greatly improved by logic algorithm called alpha beta pruning, which cuts off many obviously bad moves.<br />
    <a href="http://will.thimbleby.net/algorithms/doku.php?id=minimax_search_with_alpha-beta_pruning" target="_blank">This is a link to a nice animation explaining Alpha Beta Pruning</a>
    The search is made with increasing depth until the set time runs out. After each iteration the moves are ordered so good moves are evaluated first.

    <p>
        If you managed to get every thing right something very cool happens now. Your program suddenly starts to show some intelligence.<br />
        But you are far from finished. You probably want to make the search more efficient, searching at greater depth and improving performance.<br />
        What will probably take most of the time is score evaluation, and that can be stored in memory with a <a href="https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Zobrist+Hashing" target="_blank">Zobrist Hash Key</a> for faster lookup.
    </p>
    <h2>Performance</h2>
    <p>
        The <a href="https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Zobrist+Hashing" target="_blank">Zobrist Hash Key</a> is stored in a in memory database together with an integer containing a few data about the position.<br />
        These data only has to be calculated once. Next time same hash key shows up, the database is queried with the key.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is the data that is packed in an 32 bit integer.<br />
        The data is packed to decrease size and increase access to the database using bit shifts.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Command Number (7 bits), used for cleaning old positions not needed.</li>
        <li>If the move was legal i.e. own king in check. (1 bit)</li>
        <li>Opponent king check (1 bit)</li>
        <li>The score of the board. (13 bits)</li>
        <li>How many recursions it took to find the score. A deeper search replaces scores that are found less deeper for the same position. (5 bits)</li>
        <li>DrawByRepetion, UnsufficienMaterial, StaleMate and Mate. (4 bit, one bit each)</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Storing the depth of a search  I think is my own invention. I have not had time to benchmark with or without it but it should contribute with some improvements.</p>
    <p>
        The engine analyses about 50k positions/sec on my dual core 2.7Ghz laptop. Which is mostly enough to see about five or six moves ahead in the middle game.<br />
        Most average skilled chess players (like me) should have quite some difficulty beating the engine given the same time to think.<br />
        When testing it in a chess.com CPU game, I estimate it has a rating around 1300.<br />
        I think the best way to improve its performance would be to replace board representation with a bit board.<br />
        That would increase move generation and position evaluation so even deeper searches could be performed.
    </p>

    <h2>What I have learned during this project</h2>
    <p>It is very important to write unit tests and perhaps even write them first. In TDD you have to have a failing test before you can write the function. This is an excellent way of assuring everything is tested. </p>
    <p>
        The Alpha Beta algorithm is probably the most challenging part of a chess engine. There are many pseudo code examples on the Internet. I only managed to get on of them to work. It is the one from <a href="http://will.thimbleby.net/algorithms/doku.php?id=minimax_search_with_alpha-beta_pruning">Algorithm Wiki</a><br />
    </p>
    <p>
        Hashing is an important part of Chess programming. The board has to save a position score for faster access. The hash is stored in an 64 bit datatype but there are many more possible states that a chess game can be in.<br />
        I find it quite remarkable that there were no hash collisions after I implemented the Zobrist hashing that very effectively spreads the risk of having hash collisions.<br />
    </p>
    <p>It is important to run performance profiling. The faster the analysis becomes more positions are analyzed every second and even some small improvements can have large effects on over all performance.</p>
    <p>An other good site for learning is the <a href="https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/" target="_blank">Chess Programming Wiki</a></p>
    <p>
        The source is hosted on Git hub <a href="https://github.com/KristianEkman/ChessAi" target="_blank">at this location.</a> There might be some changes later on but for now i think it is time to give this little hobby project a rest!
